# vue-wordcloud tooltip fix

This is a simple fork. Some css classes used in the original vue-wordcloud are too prone to conflict,
and were causing some troubles to our projects. 
If your vue-wordcloud-tooltip is bugging tooltips, or other vue-bootstrap components, this might be useful.

For reference, see te original [project's repo](https://github.com/feifang/vue-wordcloud) 


### Install
