# vue-wordcloud tooltip fix

This is a simple fork. Some css classes used in the original vue-wordcloud are too prone to conflict,
and were causing some troubles to our projects. 
For reference, see te original [project's repo](https://github.com/feifang/vue-wordcloud) 


### Install
```
npm install vue-wordcloud-tooltip-fix

```

### Import
```
import wordcloud from 'vue-wordcloud-tooltip-fix'
```
